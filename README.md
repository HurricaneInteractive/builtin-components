# React prototyping components
**Documentation**: https://builtin.herokuapp.com/

### About
builtin is a collection of React Components that can be used for rapid prototyping or in your project. The components provide a lightweight skeleton which can be utilised to insert flexible content. Each component comes with basic theming which can be easily overwritten by custom CSS. You will be able to include all available components or select a few that will suit your current needs.

### How to use
Each component has documentation on the site above. You'll need to download the component/s that you wish to use and include in your React project. Each component comes with both a scss partial and compiled css file for you to include, this has some simple styling. Each of the components can be used out of the box to build quick MVPs or customised to suit your needs. Currently the components are not apart of a npm package.

### Dependencies
